**Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis 
and Its Limitations for ISD**

This repository contains the code used to obtain the results in the paper 'Quantum Sieving for Code-Based Cryptanalysis and Its Limitations for ISD'. 
The authors of the paper and contributors to the code are Lynn Engelberts, Simona Etinski, Johanna Loyer. 

To verify our results: 
- Running code/main.py runs the algorithms mentioned in Section 4 and creates the plot.
- Our numerical justification in Section 6 is based on code/limitations.py.
